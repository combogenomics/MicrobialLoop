Codes for the modelling of _P. tricornutum_ and _P. haloplanktis_ co-culture.

Run Model_fit_SIMPLEX_CC.m to reproduce the analysis presented in Daly et al. 2021. The code will use the set of parameters embdedded in the file SetPar.dat as starting guess for the fitting. The fitting is automatically performed using the code in SIMP*.m functions and the experimental values embedded in the files: co_culture_data_fit.txt, co_culture_aggregate_log.txt.
